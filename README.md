### Built with

### What I learned

This project was a really good learning opportunity for me to really see how you can build a project with a certain architecture combined with vanilla JS and Webpack 5.
I learned a lot how easy after initial setup to work with Webpack+JS, PostCSS, Babel. I could built it with React or any other framework but wanted to test my JS skills to the next level.
I love working with REST Apis and JSON data.
